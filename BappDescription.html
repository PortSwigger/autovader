    AutoVader integrates DOM Invader with Playwright to automatically find DOM-based vulnerabilities through context
    menu actions. The extension launches an automated browser with DOM Invader configured, injects test payloads, and
    reports findings as Scanner issues.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Scan for DOM XSS, prototype pollution, postMessage vulnerabilities, and client-side redirects through automated
        DOM Invader integration</li>
    <li>Test GET parameters, POST parameters, web messages, and all identified sources with automatic payload injection
    </li>
    <li>Configure custom payloads, HTML tags, attributes to scan, request delays, and headless operation through
        project-specific settings</li>
    <li>Auto-trigger scans from Repeater, Intruder, or other extensions using <code class="InlineCode">$canary</code>
        placeholders in requests</li>
    <li>Deduplicate findings across scans and report issues directly to Scanner with unique project-specific canaries
    </li>
    <li>Automatically detect Chromium and DOM Invader paths with manual override options if needed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Right-click on any request in Target, Proxy History, or Repeater to access the AutoVader context menu</li>
    <li>Select a scan type such as "Scan all GET params", "Scan for client side prototype pollution", or "Inject into
        all sources &amp; click everything"</li>
    <li>AutoVader launches a browser with DOM Invader, navigates to the target with appropriate payloads, and captures
        vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>Review the reported Scanner issues for DOM-based vulnerabilities identified during the automated scan</li>
    <li>Optionally configure settings like custom payloads, scan delays, and auto-run triggers through the AutoVader
        Settings panel</li>
</ol>
